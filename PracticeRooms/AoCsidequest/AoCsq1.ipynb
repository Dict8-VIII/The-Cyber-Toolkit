    "For the case number, we are going to need to get into the technical side a bit. As we saw previously, there is a lot of data in the capture on 3389, this is the default port for the Microsoft Termininal Services client, MSTSC (better known as Windows RDP). It's software used to remotely control a windows desktop. It is secured using a reasonably secure key kept on the target machine, requiring specialised tools to extract the keys. Mimikatz is one of these tools.... see where I'm going with this?<br>\n",
    "\n",
