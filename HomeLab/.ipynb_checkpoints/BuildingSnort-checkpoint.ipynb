    "For this lab, I'm building a Docker Box on Ubuntu. Technically you can run multiple solutions on Docker, but I'm still old when it comes to separation of services. Besides, we'll be doing things to the network & Docker that are really bad practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm building a VM with 2xCPU, 4GB RAM and 32GB Storage. As always I have thin provisioned my VMs as I normally overprovision for the VM requirements. A key section here is that I've allocated the NIC to my INTERNAL network. This INTERNAL is internal to the virtual enviroment and isolated from my EXTERNAL home network via the pfSense router. Don't want those two things mixing...\n",

    "### Promiscous Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "While I'm sure you know this, for packet sniffing to run, we need to recieve the packets. Who would have thought. The problem with this is that virtual switches, well, switch traffic between specific ports. Data between 2 VMs on the same virtual switch is sent between just those two VMs; our sniffer gets left out of the conversation. To bypass this, we need to tell the vSwitch to send data to everyone on the vSwitch (functionally turning the switch into a hub). Most NICs will just drop the traffic they recieve as it's not for their MAC, however our sniffer will also be configured to pick this up. If this sounds excessive, you are correct, in a large vSwitch you will end up with data everywhere, bad practice. \n",

This is known as a Unicast on the network, as only one devices recieves the data. This is great for traffic managmenet and security, as only the intended device (and the switch) recieves the data.

The \"Permiscouous\" mode we set earlier changes this operation on the internal port group. Instead of the data only going to the intended target in the switch, it is sent to all devices in the port group.
