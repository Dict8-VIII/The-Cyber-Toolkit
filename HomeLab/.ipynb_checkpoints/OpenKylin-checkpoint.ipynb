    "The recently released \"Chinese made\" OS. Spoiler, it's not, it looks to be based on an Ubuntu build. I guess the same arguement can be made for MACOS not being it's own OS, but that's getting a bit off topic.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "Download the ISO and create a new VM. I gave mine the same resources as the default Ubuntu minimum requirements. Let it boot up and load the ISO and you'll get the splash screen.<br>\n",
