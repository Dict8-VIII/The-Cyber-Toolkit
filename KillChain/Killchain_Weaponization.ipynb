    "Weaponization is the process of creating a payload that will be used for an attack. It follows Recon to understand what attacks may work, and preceeds delivery because well... you need something to deliver. In many cases, the payload will be embedded in something else (such as a PDF or email) and these are all included in weaponization.\n",
