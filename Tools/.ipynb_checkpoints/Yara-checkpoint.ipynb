    "### What Is Yara?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yara is a defensive software that can be used to analyse 'data' to assist with detection of possible threats. In this case, data refers to 'files'. This is achieved via pattern matching.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yara is a system to create rules in the file system. It can also run these rules against a defined directory. In general,  you create a group of rules and then use these to 'audit' a destination as required. There are many rules available publicly, we'll get to this a bit shortly.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules themselves are quite simple, however the strength of Yara is how these rules are applied by the technical team. A rule itself is a file, and must also include a 'destination. This can be a path, directory or ProcessID. The format is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> yara [rule].yar [destination]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A .yar file is a rule file. When the rule is 'met', it reports with the name of the rule defined in the file. An example rule, shown below, is taken from [https://tryhackme.com/room/yara](TryHackMe's Yara Room)\n",
