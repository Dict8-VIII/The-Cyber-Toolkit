    "These pages will be quite limited. I dont have access to an enterprise level environment and I'm using the free Azure account. I'm building these notes following the SC-400 course on learn.microsoft.com. I don't recommend the course on it's own. It is entirely theoretical (and a bit sales-y if I'm honest), and you aren't given access to a test environment to try out the solution. That being said, I find I've learned more by simply having to install each product, maybe it will help you too. If you want to go more in-depth than I do, you'll need an office or MS 365 account subscription.\n",
