    "Sysmon is a part of the SysInternals package, and is an expanded version of the windows event logs. It provides more details and a more granluar control system. The Events within Sysmon are still stored in the event logs here:\n",

    "Once Sysmon is installed, it persists through restarts and its primary purpose is to integrate with a SIEM system. Thats not to say you cant monitor it internally, its just where it can really shine. Sysmon itself can record multiple event types (29ish at the time of writing) and you can write either include or exclude rules to filter which events are captured. These rules are stored in the Sysmon config file. Filtering at the monitor can reduce the amount of analysis needed at the SIEM end, however if the rules are not well created it can also hide malicious activity. If starting out, its great to start with a template and configure for your environment (once you know what youre doing). THM recommended [this one by SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml).\n",
