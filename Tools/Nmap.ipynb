    "### Discovery\n",
    "These are the scan types for target discovery (is there something on this IP worth investigating).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -PR\n",
    "This arguement send a broadcast ARP request only. This is a great one to use as it's not blocked by any firewalls (as it's part of maintaining a network), but it requires you to be on the same subnet as your targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -PE -PP -PM\n",
    "These are ICMP Echo, Timestamp and Mask respectively. All run in the ICMP domain and are ways to work around a firewall. Echo tends to be blocked (and is by default most times). Timestamp and Mask requests are alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -PS -PA\n",
    "These are TCP discovery methods. -PS Uses a SYN request (on port 80 by default) and if it recieved back a response (SYNACK or RST) then treats the IP as active. It just waits for the response if run as priveliged user, or completes the handshake if not. -PA is an ACK message which will recieve a RST if the target is active (as its not part of an established message), and can only be run as priveliged user (otherwise it will run a SYN).\n",

    "### Port Connect\n",
    "Now that we know what targets to hit, we now have to decide how to confirm a port is open or closed. Because of annoying things like firewalls however, theres more to it. There are 6 possible states of a port scan. This is copied directly from [TryHackMe's nmap02 Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.\n",
    "2. Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.\n",
    "3. Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.\n",
    "4. Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.\n",
    "5. Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.\n",
    "6. Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -sT\n",
    "The sT scan is a TCP connect scan. Simply, Nmap attempts a full TCP 3way Handshake for each scanned port (and then kill it with a RST ACK if it completes). This is the only scan that doesnt require a priveliged account.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -sS\n",
    "The Sneaky Stealth Scan, or more accurately, the SYN scan. This requires a priveliged user and is mroe sneaky as it doesnt complete a connection (so is less likely to be logged). It starts with the SYN, Recieves a SYNACK and then sends a RST to kill the handshake. As you can guess, this is only more stealthy, but could still be logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -sU\n",
    "The sU scan is a UDP scan, which sort of runs opposite to the TCP scans. As UDP is stateless, we would expect no response if the port is open (as UDP 'packets' dont have a session or give a response, they are fire and forget).<br>\n",
    "A closed port however should give a ICMP \"Destination Unreachable\" response."
