    "### Forwarder\n",

    "- A web server generating/recieving web traffic\n",
    "- A windows machine with Event Logs, sysmon, powershell etc\n",
    "- A linux host with its internal logs\n",
    "- A DB server with requests, responses and errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexer\n",
    "The indexer processes the data it recieves and converts it to a standard format (normalising). This includes creating Key/Value pairs, determining the data type and storage to its internal DB. This is in preparation for the next component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search (Search Head)\n",
    "Well whats the point in all of this data if you can't search it or apply other rules? This is where the search head comes in. It can also convert the data for visualistions, export and other such tasks.\n",

Forwarders send data to the indexer who assigns the event to an index. You then search based on an index. While it's perfectly possible to send everything custom to one, it's not as efficient as it can bloat. Retention settings are also per index.\n",
