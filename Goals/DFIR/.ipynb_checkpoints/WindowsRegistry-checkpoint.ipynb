    "The 'hives' are where data is kept in the registry. Each has a specific purpose and is normally referred to by it's abbreviation. Each hive is stored in separate, hidden & protected files -> you cant open these directly from the OS except for via internal OS calls (such as those used by the registry editor). You can't copy them either. They also don't normally have file extensions (NTUSER and USRCLASS are the exceptions as .dat files). <br>\n",
