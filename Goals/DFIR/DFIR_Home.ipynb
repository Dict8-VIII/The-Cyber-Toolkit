    "Digitial Forensics is the process of collecting, preserving & investigating digital artifacts in order to find the root causes of incidents. It can also be used in legal proceedings so there are formal processes & tools required to prove a case. I'm not a lawyer, and I have no formal law training. In this book I share my own experiences and thoughts but don't take them as legal advice under any circumstances. Take my comments as hearsay and we'll both be happier...<br>\n",
