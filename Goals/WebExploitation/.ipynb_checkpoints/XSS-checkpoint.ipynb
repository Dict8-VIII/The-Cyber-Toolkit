As we can see in this page, we have a form asking for the first and last name. Once these are entered and submitted, the welcome message is displayed using both the first and last names. How this is done in the web applicaiton, is that the fields are passed in the URL as a GET request, which is then pulled out for the welcome. <br>\n",
