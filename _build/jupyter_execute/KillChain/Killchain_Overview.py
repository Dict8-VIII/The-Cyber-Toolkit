# # Killchain Overview
# 
# The "killchain" is a generic term for the process that an attacker follows to penetrate a system. Each step follows on from the last in a linear order and breaking a link in the chain breaks the attack... at least in theory. Either way, it is a popular concept and improving any of the links from the blue side can only be helpful.<br>
# 
# "Killchain" is a generic term, but there are standard models that can be used:
# 
# 1. ["The Cyber Killchain"](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), by Lockhead Martin
# 
# 2. ["The Unified Kill Chain"](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf), by Paul Pols
# 
# This section is based around a simplified Killchain that bas been used in [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/pentestingfundamentals). The sections are:
# 
# 1. Information Gathering
# 2. Ennumeration / Scanning
# 3. Exploitation
# 4. Privilege Escalation
# 5. Post Exploitation
