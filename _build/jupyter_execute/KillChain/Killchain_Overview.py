# # Killchain Overview
# 
# The "killchain" is a generic term for the process that an attacker follows to penetrate a system. Each step follows on from the last in a linear order and breaking a link in the chain breaks the attack... at least in theory. Either way, it is a popular concept and improving any of the links from the blue side can only be helpful.<br>
