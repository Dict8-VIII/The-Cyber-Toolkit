    "# Killchain - Info Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the Killchain process is Information Gathering. The purpose of info gathering is to try understand your target. The more you know about your target, the better your chances of exploiting the system. It can be quite hard to lock this down as well. In the real world, we have devices on networks because we want them to be found; the challenge is finding the right balance while keeping the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 kinds of info gathering, Active and Passive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active: Hitting the target itself. This tends to move to the \"scanning\" stage\n",
    "Passive: Gathering info outside the target\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to do reconnaissance? \n",
    "- We need to know our target\n",
    "- Publicly available data can be used for some attacks\n",
    "- Hidden endpoints arent so hidden\n",
    "- Old information can be valuable\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what can we do without hitting the target? Well a lot actually. I mentioned above that hitting the target may be the next stage, but that really depends on what you're doing. Publicly available data may included the target's website, but if you're on the 'Green Path' (only doing what general users will do) then it can still be considered info gathering.\n",

    "### Social Media\n",

    "Another one that should be overlooked, job adds can give away the technology and structure of an organisation. Are they looking for SQL Admins? MongoDB? Python3? Web admins?\n",

    "How's your google-fu? Google is a great source for public data and it's free. What more could you want? Theres a few options with Dorking. Theres even a full list of search terms for the young grasshoppers out there: https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database\n",

    "### NS Lookup\n",
    "nslookup (or name server lookup) queries a domain for its name servers (DNS). It can be used to query the site's DNS server for possible records. While this is considered passive, I'd list this in the ACTIVE group of commands. The basic format is:\n",
