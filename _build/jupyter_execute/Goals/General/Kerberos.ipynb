    "\n",
    "- SPN: Service Principal Name. An identifier given to a service instance to associate it with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account so a service needs an SPN set.<br>\n",

    "The tickets themselves dont have file extensions, but depending on your attacks these may be presented as files. A .kirbi is for Rubeus and .ccache for Impacket. They are usually base64 encoded and depending on the ticket can be used for a different attacks. A TGT must be used authenicated with the KDC to get service tickets, but this can return other details. More below.<br>\n",
