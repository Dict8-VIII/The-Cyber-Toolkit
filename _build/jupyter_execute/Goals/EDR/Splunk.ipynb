    "\n",
    "### Indexer\n",
    "The indexer processes the data it recieves and converts it to a standard format (normalising). This includes creating Key/Value pairs, determining the data type and storage to its internal DB. This is in preparation for the next component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search (Search Head)\n",
    "Well whats the point in all of this data if you can't search it or apply other rules? This is where the search head comes in. It can also convert the data for visualistions, export and other such tasks. You can think of this as the \"GUI\" of Splunk, and it is where we will spend most of our time. Throughout this page, when I'm refering to \"Splunk\", it is this web GUI.\n",
