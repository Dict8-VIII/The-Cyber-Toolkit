    "Those of you playing along at home may wonder why I have 4 \"up-one-level\" in the path. The simple answer is it was an educated guess. If the are asking for /etc/ then we're on a linux box. Linux tends to host in /var/www/html, so 3 would be fine. One of the great things about trying to access a directory by 'returning' to the root directory, is that even if you overshoot how many levels up you need to go, extras just put you in the exact same spot.\n",
