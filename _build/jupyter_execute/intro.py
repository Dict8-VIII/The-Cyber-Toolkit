# # The Cyber Toolkit
# I've written this book for a few reasons
# 
# - To keep track of and formalise my notes on my "Try Hack Me" experience
# 
# - To publish some write-ups when I feel confident enough in my knowledge
# 
# - To show off my methods
# 
# - To learn something new
# 
# - And simply because I can
# 
# 
# As I progress through this I'll add extra sections and I'm sure modify things all over the place.
