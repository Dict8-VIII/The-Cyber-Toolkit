    "# Threats\n",
    "\n",
    "Threats is the wider term for any entity that may wish to attack your environment. While 'hackers' is the casual term for threats, it can also include the different levels of hackers, natural incidents, mistakes etc. As 'hackers' is the most common, what kind of hackers are there? Hackers can be divided by 2 metrics, their knowledge/threat level and their motives. The most clearly defined is the motives.\n",

    "## Hackers - By Motive\n",
    "\n",
    "### White Hat\n",
    "These are the professionals who operate within the scope of law and regulation. They work for a business (or are contracted to one) to engage in a range of cyber security tasks. They have permission from an entity to perform task on a system that they own, within a 'scope' of engagement. They have well defined documentation of what they are permitted to do on a system and follow this to the letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example would be a Pen Test (Penetration Test) where an airport contracts a security company to test their publicly exposed network to attempt to gain access. They are only permitted to operate within a defined target range and DDoS attacks are not permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their motive is purely professional and within agreed terms. Any findings are reported professionally, and remediation is advised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black Hat\n",
    "The opposite of a White Hat is a Black Hat. They operation with no permission and their motivation is purely personal. This could range from a child sitting at home trying to guess Mum's Facebook password, to a fully underground network of hackers who operation on a global scale. Their motivation could be financial, political, anarchist or simply because they want to know if they can. The KEY definition of a Black Hat is that they attack a system without permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grey Hat\n",
    "There is a 3rd type, however personally I think it should be considered a Black Hat. A Grey hat is a Black Hat who is hacking with a positive motive but no permission. An example would be someone who hacks a website without permission but shares the method of entry with the owner of the site, with the hope they will fix it (or they ask for \\$\\$\\$ before they will share the method). The \"Grey Hat\" title should be handled with caution, I Am Not A Lawyer, but if you are caught your motivation is irrelevant and you will likely be considered a \"Black Hat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some may put 'hacktivists' in this category. A 'hacktivist' is an activist using hacking to threaten a business. This could be from a DDoS using LOIC to defacing a website. None of this is legal in the physical world, it's not online either.\n",
    "<hr>\n",

    "## Hackers - by Knowledge\n",
    "The second metric is the knowledge of the hacker. While not clearly defined, there are levels of threat and considerations must be made for all to some extent. The below is a less -> more threat level as I see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: some sites define 7 levels, example: https://blog.knowbe4.com/the-7-levels-of-hackers. I feel even this comes short as a \"hacktivist\" could also a \"Script Kiddie\" or a \"Skilled Hacking Group\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Script Kiddie\"\n",
    "Even the name is an insult to many hackers. A 'script kiddie' is stereotyped as the 10yr old sitting on the family computer trying to 'hack Facebook'. Another example would be a 'hacktivist' who learned hacking from a twitter post (did someone say LOIC?). It’s not a sophisticated attack, but one of the things about some attacks is you don't need to be. Enough people doing something simple at the same time can still be a massive headache (see DDoS below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hacking Group\n",
    "Probably the vaguest group in this list, a skilled hacking group could be many things. I would define it as \"an individual or groups of hackers who have enough knowledge to be dangerous\". This could range from a well-co-ordinated group of script kiddies to \"Anonymous\"; (though “Anonymous” could be a group of script kiddies too). These are the people who are hacking as a semi-serious hobby and don't have the finances to mount full attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Professional Hackers\n",
    "These are the people who are skilled enough to do this as a job (legitimate or not). They are skilled with any number of attacks and are likely aware of any new or emerging exploit. They have the time and experience to be a real threat to most businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### APTs & NSAs\n",
    "I've thrown these together, as most APTs are NSAs. An APT is an \"Advanced Persistent Threat\". These are the people who are incredibly skilled and have all the time in the world to find a way in. The majority of these are NSAs, or \"Nation State Actors\", the government branches who fight wars behind a computer. If you are targeted by one of these, you have 2 options.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Disconnect yourself from the internet entirely, shut down all your devices and leave them in a tin foil safe in the bottom of the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accept that sooner or later, the chances are they will find a way in. No computer is perfectly secure and because of things like Zero Days, you don't even know what you need to protect against. We all thought Windows 7 was secure when it came out and even during support. That was destroyed overnight by \"Eternal Blue\", CVE-2017-0144. If you think the NSA didn't have that one for years before we knew about it, you haven’t been paying attention...\n",
    "\n",
    "You have one lifeline though. APTs don't target randomly, just remember that nothing on the internet is ever truly secure. Logging can assist with working out when they get in, but you really need to invest in this if you want to really protect yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Automated Tool\n",
    "This is one I came across while forming my groups and I can appreciate the addition. An automated tool is 'theoretical' software that contains the skill of an APT. The reason this is more of a threat is that a well scripted tool could be run by any of the previous groups. Imagine being able to take a current MetaSploit version back to 2016 before Microsoft had been disclosed \"Eternal Blue\". Suddenly you have a tool that gets you Admin access on (practically) any networked Windows 7 box. Ouch.\n",
