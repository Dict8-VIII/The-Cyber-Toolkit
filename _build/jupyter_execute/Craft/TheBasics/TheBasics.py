# # The Basics
# 
# So, you've decided to start your path in Cyber Security, or more likely, hacking sounds fun. Great! It can be! But there is more to it than getting a hoodie and balaclava and hunching over a laptop (in the dark obviously). Hacking is a career path, regardless of what popular media tells you about hackers.

# ## What is Cyber Security?
# 
# <hr>

# ## The CIA Triad
# 
# The CIA triad is one of the fundamental concepts of Cyber Security and encompases the domains that need to be protected. As a side note, it doesnt mention human protection, but this should be considered the priority in all domains. <br>
# 
# CIA doesnt refer the the US Government agency, but rather Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Without all 3 domains protected, you are in a vulnerable state.
# 
# ### Confidentiality
# This domain is focused on protecting access to information and ensuring only authorised users/devices can access protected data. This could include access control, encryption & IAM.
# 
# ### Integrity
# Integrity is ensuring that data hasnt been modified, and if it has you know who did. This includes checksums, Non-repudiation and backups.
# 
# ### Availiablity
# Lastly, Availibility is making sure that services & data can be accessed and aren't 'offline'. If someone is authorised, they should be able to access information.

# ## Terminolgy Used
# 
# There is a large amount of jargon used when discussing attacks. The below shows how this looks in an overarching scale<br>
# ![Terminology.png](../../images/HackerCraft/Terminology.png)<br>
# 
# - A THREAT is any person/group/organistion who isn't following the 'green path' so is therefore attacking the system<br>
# - An EVENT is any recordable action performed by a THREAT. This could be a ports scan, attempted SQL injection or a failed password attempt<br>
# - A VULNERABILITY is any weakness in the system<br>
# - A THREAT can EXPLOIT a VULNERABILITY to access the system outside their expected access. This is a BREACH<br>
# - An INCIDENT can be one or many linked BREACHES or EVENTS<br>
