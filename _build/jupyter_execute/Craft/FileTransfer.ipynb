    "Ok, so you have this great exploit that you can push to a target machine. You even have a low privelige users who can put the file for you. Now the question becomes; \"how do I get my file to the remote machine\"? As is rather standard with this sort of stuff, the answer is \"Many ways\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Just re-make the file\n",
    "So this one is often overlooked, but with script files it's probably the easiest method. Simply create a blank file on the target machine and write your script to the file (naturally this only works for scripts). An example of this would be transfering LinEnum to a machine by writing the file with nano or vi. <br>\n",
    "Remember to change the script to have execute permissions when you're done.\n",

    "Like it says on the box, a simple http server you can host locally for a remote machine to connect to. On your local machine, create a folder that you want to host files from. In that folder, run the below command.\n",
