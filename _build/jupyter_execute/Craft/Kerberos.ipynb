    "- TGT: Ticket Granting Ticket. An Authentication ticket that requests service tickets from TGS for domain resources.\n",

    "- KDC: Key Distribution Centre. A service for issuing TGTs and Service tickets. It has 2 components\n",
    "  - Authentication Service (AS)\n",

    "- AS: Authentication Service. Issues TGT that are used by the TGS to request access to other machines and service tickets\n",

    "- TGS: Ticket Granting Service. Tages a TGT and returns a ticket to a domain machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- SPN: Service Principal Name. An identifier given to a service instance to associate it with a domain service account. Windows requires that services have a domain service account so a service needs an SPN set.\n",

    "- KDC LT Key: KDC Long Term Secret Key. a KDC key is based on the KRBTGT service account. Used to encrypt the TGT and sign PAC.\n",

    "4. TGS-REP: The KDC verifies the TGT and that the user has access, then returns a session key for the service\n",

    "The tickets themselves dont have file extensions, but depending on your attacks these may be presented as files. A .kirbi is for Rubeus and .ccache for Impacket. They are usually base64 encoded and depending on the ticket can be used for a different attacks. A TGT must be used authenicated with the KDC to get service tickets, but this can return other details. More below.\n",
