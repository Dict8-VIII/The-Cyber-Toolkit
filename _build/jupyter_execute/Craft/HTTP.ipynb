    "# HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol is the most common web protocol. It is unencrypted and stateless, meaning each request is handled independently of each other. Request a page and an image on the page are 2 separate requests. For sites that require a login to access a page, this is managed by cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "While web browsers are commonly used for retrieving pages, this isn’t a requirement. A telnet client could also request these (or curl). HTTP servers are normally hosted on port 80, but don’t have to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Methods (Verb)\n",
    "An HTTP method is the action type requested on communication to a server. These are called methods or verbs. The most common are:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET\n",
    "POST\n",
    "PUT\n",
    "DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request process\n",
    "The easiest verb to show is a get request. To do this over telnet\n",
    "\n",
    ">Telnet [serverIP] 80\n",
    ">Get / HTTP/1.1\n",
    ">host: telnet\n",
    "> press enter a couple of times\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line, we are simply creating a TCP handshake to the server on port 80.<br>\n",
    "In the second line, we are getting the \"/\" file, normally index.html, and providing a protocol to use<br>\n",
    "In the last line, we need to tell the server our host, this could really be anything but must be provided.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If this all goes well, you will receive the page code to your terminal. Simple.\n",
