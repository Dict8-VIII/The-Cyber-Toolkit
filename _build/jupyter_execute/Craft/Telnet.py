# # Telnet 
# 
# The non-secure version of SSH, Telnet is a legacy protocol that runs on port 23 by default. It is used for the same role as SSH (a remote shell), but is UNENCRYPTED in transit. If you send a login over telnet, anyone who is sniffing the data can see it in plain text.

# Windows servers need a telnet client installed to run a remote connection, Linux comes with it (most of the time)
