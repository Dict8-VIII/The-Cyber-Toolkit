# # The Basics
# 
# So, you've decided to start your path in Cyber Security, or more likely, hacking sounds fun. Great! It can be! But there is more to it then getting a hoodie and balaclava and hunching over a laptop (in the dark obviously). Hacking is a career path, regardless of what popular media tells you about hackers.

# ### Types of Hackers
# So that leads us to the first note, what kind of hackers are there? Hackers can be divided by 2 metrics, their knowledge and their motives. The most clearly defined is the motives;
# 
# #### White Hat
# These are the professionals who operate within the scope of law and regulation. They work for a business (or are contracted to one) to engage in a range of cyber security tasks. They have permission from an entity to perform task on a system that they own, within a 'scope' of engagement. They have well defined documentation of what they are permitted to do on a system and follow this to the letter. 
# 
# An example would be a Pen Test (Penetration Test) where an airport contracts a security company to test their publicly exposed network to attempt to gain access. They are only permitted to operate within a defined target range and DDoS attacks are not permitted.
# 
# Their motive is purely professional and within agreed terms. Any findings are reported professionally and remediation is advised.
# 
# 
# #### Black Hat
# The opposite of a White Hat is a Black Hat. They operation with no permission and their motivation is purely personal. This could range from a child sitting at home trying to guess Mum's facebook password, to a fully underground network of hackers who operation on a global scale. Their motivation could be financial, political, anarchist or simply because they want to know if they can. The KEY definiton of a Black Hat is that they attack a system without permission.
# 
# 
# #### Grey Hat
# There is a 3rd type, however personally it should be considered a Black Hat. A Grey hat is a Black Hat who is hacking with a positive motive but no permission. An example would be someone who hacks a website without permission, but shares the method of entry with the owner of the site, with the hope they will fix it (or they ask for \$\$\$ before they will share the method). They "Grey Hat" title should be handled with caution, I Am Not A Lawyer, but if you are caught your motivation is irrelivant and you will likely be considered a "Black Hat".
