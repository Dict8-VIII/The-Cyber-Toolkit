# ## Autoruns
# So many autostart locations... Its not just startup though. Login, IE launch, Media players, explorer, RUN, RUNONCE, Registry keys, services, toolbars, notifications... blah blah blah... you get the point. Theres a LOT.<br>

# ## ProcDump
# For monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike. As its also a feature of Process Explorer I wont include too much here.
# 
# ### Arguements
# There are some, just use process explorer though...

# ## Process Explorer
# Theres a lot to unpack here. Process Explorer is simply a way to examine the process running on the device and where this is linked.<br>
# 
# Each process has a colour
# - Purple: Indicates files may be packed
# - Red: Process is exiting (stopping)
# - Green: Freshly spawned (just created)
# - Light Blue: Running bythe same account that started Process Explorer
# - Dark Blue: Currently selected
# - Pink: Process is a service
# - Grey: Process is suspended (manually)
# 
# 
# Still more to do here....
