    "Nessus is an automated vulnerability scanner for Web Applications. It includes quite a few modules, and MANY pluggins to make it rather easy to scan a web application in search of <strike>Bug Bounties</strike> vulnerabilities. There is a free edition but it requires registration for an activation key. I've only done a bit on this so far but it looks like a great tool to add to the Active Scanning stage of an attack. You can start [here](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).\n",

    "## Launching\n",
    "Once you have Nessus installed, it must be started on your device as a service.\n",
