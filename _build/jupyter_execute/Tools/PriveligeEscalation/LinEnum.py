# # LinEnum
# 
# A self contained script for enumerating linux privelige escalation points. It can be downloaded from its gitub repository at https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.
# 
# Copy the script to the target machine using any [file transfer method](../../Craft/FileTransfer.ipynb), allow execute permissions and run it
# 
# > ./linenum.sh -s [user&password] -t
# 
# * -t : run the 'big' tests, may take a bit of time
# * The -s and -t are optional
#

# 
# Some tools (Such as linpeas include colour coding), but unfortunately that isnt a feature of LinEnum. I feel it is more comprehensive than LinPeas however.
