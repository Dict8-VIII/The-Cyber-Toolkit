    "Shock, theres still a lot, but we can get started now. The count of trees inside a radius area is a strange one. I was thinking how I could do a 'moving' mask and filter through that, but I felt it was excessive and likely not the right path. Going through the hints, they refer to a H3 cell of size 10 being roughly that size. After a bit of research on the topic, I had so many 'what if's' with the static cells; what if the count overlaps? Do the instructions include dead trees? Is it four 'cherries' or more etc etc...<br>\n",
