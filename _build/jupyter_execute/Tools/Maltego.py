# # Maltego
# 
# Maltego is a 'mind mapping' / flowcharting OSINT tool, for those who are more visual with their process.
# 
# ## The Basics
# With Maltego, you start with basic 'known' information and apply a transform to convert it to more data (or entities). Info about the transforms can be found here https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/
# 
# ### Installing
# Maltego itself has a community edition, however some transforms are charged above this. Again you may or may not need your own keys for some transforms.
