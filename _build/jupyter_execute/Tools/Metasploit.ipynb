    "# Metasploit Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The MetaSploitFramework (msf / Metasploit) is a collection of exploits, payloads, scripts, enum tools,  has its own custom shell, nmap and will probably even walk the dog if you asked nicely enough. <br>\n",

    "    - Stages: larger payloads used by a stager.\n",
    "    - Singles tend to be in a 'higher' level and further data is _ separated. Stagers are / separated.\n",
