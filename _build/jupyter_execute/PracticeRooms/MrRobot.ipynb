    "# MR Robot CTF room\n",
    "\n",
    "This page is the walkthrough for the Mr Robot CTF Room. It's a moderate level room and very little guidance is given in the task itself. It does include a walkthrough by DarkStar, but I like that youre expected to have some independance when challenging the room. The flags have multiple steps between them, so you arent even quite sure if youre on the right path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this room, I learned about using Hydra to brute force a web page, instead of Burpsuite so thats quite helpful. I'm a bit unhappy about the password brute forcing though. The dictionary is quite large and the webserver doesnt seem to handle this very well (I'm not even sure if you could completed the dictionary in a 2hr window as the password is near the end). I even wrote my own program to bruteforce the password at a custom speed but the server couldnt keep up with this either. In Darkstar's walkthrough he doesnt even show it running, just says what the resulting password is.\n",
