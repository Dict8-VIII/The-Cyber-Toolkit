# 
# List of practice sites for CTF challenges
# I got this list from my study, but have increased/modified/altered for my purposes
# <br>
# - [bWAP](http://itsecgames.com)
#   - A buggy web app, like Juice shop
# - [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) 
#   - Cryptographic programming challenges
#   - I like the look of this one, the humour isnt bad either (and I think I can do 9th grader maths...)
# - [CTF365](https://ctf365.com)
#   - This one is interesting, probably my next step. You build a server in a virtual internet, where anything is permitted.
#   - Looks like a GREAT way to work on blue teaming and red.
# - [CTFlearn](https://ctflearn.com)
#   - Looks like general ctf practice. You need an account though
# - [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org)
#   - A running dashboard of ongoing/planned CTFs
# - [Game of Hacks](http://gameofhacks.com)
#   - Focused around application pen testing (actual code, not web apps)
# - [Google Gruyere](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com)
#   - Vulnerable web app, stored online
#   - It specifies what level of attack is needed (black box, white-check code, mix)
# - Google XSS Game - Cross-site scripting for beginners<br>
# - Hack.me<br>
#   - Looks to be removed, provided by eLearnSecurity
#   - Maybe turned to THM?
# - Hacking-Lab<br>
# - IO<br>
# - Juice shop - Vulnerable web app<br>
#   - Provided by OWASP, web pen testing
# - Microcorruption - ARM disassembling<br>

# - picoCTF<br>
# - Portswiggerâ€™s Web Security Academy<br>
