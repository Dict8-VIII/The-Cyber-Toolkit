    "# FTP\n",
    "\n",
    "FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a common method of transferring files on a network. It can be used from a web browser or FTP client. An FTP server listens on port 21 by default and you can even attempt a connection via telnet. It will connect, but as FTP uses port 21 for initial connection only (and transfers files over a different port), the transfer will fail. As you can probably guess by the fact telnet can be used, FTP is unencrypted.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 modes to FTP<br>\n",
    "1. Active: A new connection is made from the Server to the Client on port 20<br>\n",
    "2. Passive: A new connection is made from the Client to the Server on a port >1023<br>\n",
