    "\n",
    "#### -PR\n",
    "This arguement send a broadcast ARP request only. This is a great one to use as it's not blocked by any firewalls (as it's part of maintaining a network), but it requires you to be on the same subnet as your targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -PE -PP -PM\n",
    "These are ICMP Echo, Timestamp and Mask respectively. All run in the ICMP domain and are ways to work around a firewall. Echo tends to be blocked (and is by default most times). Timestamp and Mask requests are alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### -PS -PA\n",
    "These are TCP discovery methods. -PS Uses a SYN request (on port 80 by default) and if it recieved back a response (SYNACK or RST) then treats the IP as active. It just waits for the response if run as priveliged user, or completes the handshake if not. -PA is an ACK message which will recieve a RST if the target is active (as its not part of an established message), and can only be run as priveliged user (otherwise it will run a SYN)."
