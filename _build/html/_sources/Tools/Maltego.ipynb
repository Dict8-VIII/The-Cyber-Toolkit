    "\n",
    "Maltego is a 'mind mapping' / flowcharting OSINT tool, for those who are more visual with their process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics\n",
    "With Maltego, you start with basic 'known' information and apply a transform to convert it to more data (or entities). Info about the transforms can be found here https://www.maltego.com/transform-hub/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing\n",
    "Maltego itself has a community edition, however some transforms are charged above this. Again you may or may not need your own keys for some transforms. "
