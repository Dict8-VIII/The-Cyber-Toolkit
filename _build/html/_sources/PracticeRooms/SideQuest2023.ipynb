    "# Advent Of Cyber Side Quest 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, THM released an 'advanced' challenge along side their beginner level \"Advent of Cyber\" event over christmas. This was aimed at advanced/insane level participants.<br>\n",
    "While I don't yet consider myself advanced, at least globally speaking, insane is right up my alley. Whats the worst that can happen?<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Spoiler Alert: I ended up having to rebuild my attack box.... 4? times so far? Thats the worst that can happen :-)*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This challenge was very 'trial by fire'. Part of the rules were NO sharing of hints during the challenge period. No sharing of room, suggesting paths, nothing.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, during the challenge<br>\n",
    "- I completed the first room, so much fun there<br>\n",
    "- Got to the second room, found what I wanted to do (and had to brush up on my assembly and hex)<br>\n",
    "- 3rd room was found<br>\n",
    "- 4th room was found<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While I didn't complete the challenges during the window, they are really fun for pushing yourself. I'll keep going with them with the hope I can complete them all without walkthroughs! <br>\n",
